# fibonacci-grid

Create a grid of 50x50. When you click on a cell, all values in the
cells in the same row and column are increased by 1. If a cell is
empty, it will get a value of 1. After each change a cell will briefly
turn yellow. If 5 consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
are next to each other, these cells will briefly turn green and will
be cleared.
